Who the fuck knows. \n\nEveryone keeps commenting about the IRS, but the truth is you’re fine. You didn’t fuck your parents. You’re not fucked. All you managed to do was ass fuck yourself. Why? Well from what I’ve gathered, you have no idea what in the actual fuck you were doing. Kid, good job making some money, but you managed to lose it all and now you’ve got to pay taxes on your gains for 2021.\n\nI’m not in the business of advising people in regards to their taxes anymore as it was boring as fuck; my dad’s a CPA I was on my way. I did it for corporate America right out of collage; I hated it so I can give you some quick advice. \n\nMy question is:\n\n> Early in 2021 i hit it big on gme and more spacs and made 200k in an account still in my name. I then sold and transferred all that money over into an account in my parents name. This was my biggest mistake. \n\n> my parents account ended -300k\n\nI need to understand this. Please clarify. You SOLD GME, then transferred PROFITS into an account; what kind of account? From what you said, I gather an investing account. Did your parents let you invest on their behalf? Were you seriously making dumbass high risk investments based off of WSB in your parents name? You are not an investor, you’re a retard. \n\nWhat you’ve managed to do, is fuck yourself. If your parents have no other investments, they have $3,000 they can carry over. They should probably thank you. \n\nThe transaction that occurred in your name for GME and Spacs will be seen as a gain for 2021. So, that means that money you made in 2021; you’ll be paying capital gains tax on that 200k which I’d assume would be 32%. \n\nI still can’t believe you sold, then transferred into another investment account in your parents name? What the fuck was the point of doing that? Why move it to an investment account and then invest it in the same fucking thing?\n\nI’m being a dick. Kid, I say kid but I’m only 30, but I’m trying to be serious here, you ass fucked your self. But all-in-all you’ve made like over $350k, you just at worst have to pay $45k in taxes or so, you’ll be fine.\n\nEdit: great fucking job on the gains though; also go get yourself a CPA. Find one that’s been in business for years like family owned CPA; old guy not some middle aged/young guy. Or find a big CPA firm business. Pay whatever the fee is; stay away from H&R Block and that shit. Also, down the line in 2-3 years you might get a CP-2000 notice. Highly unlikely if you get a CPA to handle your taxes this year and the next few years. But in any case if you do, don’t panic.

That \\*easy\\* signal will tell people whether they should hedge or not. Just looking at the angle of the trend is easy for those of us who've done chart time, but to beginners the difference between a pullback and a run in either direction can be really confusing... hell, I'm good at it and sometimes my own bias overtakes my rationality.\n\nThe good news is this can easily be accomplished with 5 moving averages:  \n\n\nThe SMMA (smoothed moving average) 20, 50, 100, and 200 and the EMA (exponential moving average) 50... all on the S&P and NASDAQ yearly chart. (SPY and QQQ work, too... same chart basically.)  \n\n\nPertinent beginner rule: ALWAYS TRADE WITH THE MARKET, unless your stock is decoupled from the market or moves against the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut all SMMAs on one chart. \n\nIn a bull market: All 4 will be in order 20, 50, 100, 200 with the average spreading out over time. That indicates strong upward index movement, which is positive pressure for indexed stocks. \n\nIn a bear market: The 4 tighten, then flip. In the worst stock trend, these are upside down. When the market starts to recover, these will start to get closer and begin crossing until they straighten out. Until they straighten out, the market is not in a solid, confirmed bull run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEMA 50 is critical: The market bounces off of this until the trend changes. If it's under the EMA 50, this means market weakness.\n\nLots of people got confused when the S&P dipped afterhours today. The answer was that it rejected off the EMA 50, meaning we're still in a bearish trend even though we left the January down channel.\n\nWill it continue to dip? Unless you run a massive hedge fund, you don't know. Hell if you do, you probably still don't know for sure. LOL\n\nBut until it gets above these moving averages, it's an indication that the market will trade down and that buying is risky. It's also a clear hedge signal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock you want to buy trades with the S&P and the S&P yearly chart is below the EMA 50 and the SMMAs are inverting like right now, the market is working against you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce people get this down, they can move on to support/resistance and setting entry/exit targets. But the first thing is to understand which side of the trend the market is on because otherwise it will fake you out and fuck you up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people start on the wrong side of chart TA and go for chart patterns, Elliott Waves, Fib and channel analysis, etc, because they want to predict the future. The chart tells you the past, not the future, but the past can tell you important things about how people are trading in the short term.\n\nBeginners should ignore people on the Internet who draw like 50 year trendlines or Fib sequences and then just call tops/bottoms... sometimes they get lucky and get it right. Sometimes they pick up on patterns. If you don't know how these work, you have no way of knowing who might be working off of good information and who's just drawing shit on a chart.\n\nPart of this is ALWAYS having a plan when the market moves in either direction. Know when to sell to stop loss, and know when you plan to collect profits, and know what to do if it falls short.\n\nWhen I started doing these things and checking them before entering a trade, I stopped making 90% of my bad trades."", 'Here’s a non yolo advice. \n\nIf you invest the $69k into SPY, at 10% annual yield and pay no taxes, you’ll get to $300k in exactly… 16 years.\n\nSo… make another kid and get them to college?']",[],[],['Summary: stop buying GME and TSLA you giant idiots'],"['In all honesty I don\'t think its done.
