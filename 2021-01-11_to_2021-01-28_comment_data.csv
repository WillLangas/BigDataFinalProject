There was no way in hell it would go bankrupt any time soon. Furthermore the average gamer does not have the internet speeds needed to go 100% digital only. Physical purchases will still be required for some time.\n\nMichael Burry (Big Short fame) hopped in for a huge chunk with a contrarian play amidst the short frenzy. Ryan Cohen (founder of Chewy) then hopped in as an activist investor and has continued loading up to over 10% for months. The board played a game of chicken with him lining up a shelf offering, but proceeded to flinch after he upped his stake even further.\n\nAs all of this has been happening the stock was mooning from the $3-$5 range up to the mid teens and low 20s these past few months, with some nose bleed dips in between. Microsoft has been revealed to have a revenue sharing partnership with GME where GME gets a cut of future digital downloads made on XBoxes originally purchased at GME.\n\nThe console cycle hit, and it's clear that alone will be enough to let GME at worse tread water for another 6 months as they allegedly start transitioning to a much larger online presence. Game resale continues to be a decent revenue stream as well.\n\nAll the while, short interest has not really let up as of December 31st. \n\nRyan Cohen was just recently offered a spot on the board this week and that may have been the final straw for some of these major short players. He turned Chewy into an online phenomenon this year and people are essentially shook that he will take over as an executive at Game Stop and get them headed in the same direction.\n\nBottom line, for at least a fraction of shorters the bankruptcy thesis is now blown up and they're looking for a way out without too much bleeding. Melvin Capital was allegedly averaging a borrow price of around $24 per share, but we just blew right past that yesterday.\n\nThere are more shorts borrowed then shares in existence right now, and a lot of big dogs are not willing to part ways with them for anything under triple digits a share.

GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ', ""My current theory is that brokers (maybe with a nudge from those filthy bears at melvin) have noticed that most of the retail long position is actually pretty leveraged on margin accounts. Naturally as volatility rises on positions, brokers raise margin reqs so that they can minimize their own risk (and in the process margin call all these positions helping out the shorts). And that's why they're presenting such high short availability. They're expecting a lot of long positions to free up next week. The bullish counter argument is that these raised margin requirements should also fuck over retail shorts by raising their margin requirements which is a lot more lethal since shorting is based on the premise of high high leverage through borrowing the entire share. Also, some say that margin calls beginning to show up at these lower levels could be indicative of similar albeit less intense things happening at the institutional level. So overall, you're right. This is not bullish at all, but we'll find out more on that later. The real light for us tho is that GME is a long anyway hold to begin with especially with all the DD thats coming out on what they're doing with their stores.

Right now gamers are forced to buy their equipment ""blind"" (PC and console alike!); there\'s certainly market for niche equipment that\'s not filled by Best Buy (they focus on broad consumer goods, not gamer goods).\n\nOf course, there is still space for high-margin items like collectibles, and  stock of physical game disks, consoles, etc.  \n\n*3)Community outreach:*\n\n Gamers go into gamestop just to stop in and browse.  Chat with people who\'ve worked there and they all agree: they get people coming in every day just to chill.  These people chat with the employees who are always super friendly.   *Gamers want to go to gamestop!*\n\nTo capitalize on this the store space must become more inviting.  a) The showroom is part of this: it\'s flashy and pretty.  That\'s why Apple stores are such a hit.  The showroom should be prominently in view through the windows.  b) Temporary event space. A small (eg 8x8) space for: console tournaments; CCG games; VR; snacks. The simple visual cue of having \'lounge\' space makes people feel more welcome as they browse. Right now the GameStop experience feels ... like a store.\n\nNote on VR:  temp-to-permanent VR setup visible from the windows can draw customers in.  Not sure on insurance needs for this.\n\n*4: weakness in small game stores.*  Game stores have been in dire straits for a number of years.  This is especially true for board and card games, whose community is mainly served by very small independent stores.  I don\'t think GME should get into board games -- they take a lot of space -- but CCGs like Pokemon and Magic take very little space, have decent margin and come with a built-in-community (they are always looking for a place to play!).   As smaller stores are pressured out this leaves space  for GME to grow.\n\nI\'ve spent 3 minutes in MS paint,   [This my schematic for your average New GameStop storefront.](https://i.imgur.com/omWs56v.png)', 'PC Gaming Builds are going  to ruin Gamestop... uneducated... will not have updated Stock, will not have Variety, think you can   compete w/ Amazon,, New-egg pricing? have any of you every built?? at GME they will tell you the PC your getting you wont  get to choose..  might as swell order from [Cyberpowerpc.com](https://Cyberpowerpc.com) (cheaper then gme) all  the hard stuff your feeble  mind cant handle is  already done', ""Seriously?

With Biden's plan for 50% of vehicles to be EVs by 2050, BB is looking attractive to capitalize off the need for software for these vehicles.  It basically boils down to BB having positioned itself for this opportunity over the past 5 years by developing the software and getting safety certifications (which are very hard to get).    \n\n\nThe EV market is looking like it could mirror the smartphone market, with Tesla being the iPhone and all other EVs by other manufacturers running off QNX like how all other phones run off Android.

They invest heavily in security, not just cyber security, and are considered one of the leading security companies in the world.\n2. 2019 they acquired Cylance, one of the nations leading cybersecurity firms, which currently has a market cap of 12b. BB, as of this time, has a market cap of around 6-7b, which is an almost gaurantee that BB will at the very least, 2x the current price.\n3. QNX is the leading OS for automated systems, EVs, machinery, medical robots, and currently powers over 175 million vehicles. It\'s adopted heavily in Chinese EV, and there\'s a big big chance that Apples & Hyundai\'s partnership in making an EV, is powered by QNX.\n4. Basically, QNX is powering most of the EV\'s you see today. It does not power Tesla, as they have their own OS built ontop of Linux, but Linux is open source and not considered secure. So there\'s rumors that there could be something brewing between Tesla and BB.\n5.

So get a little confused as to which control module people are referring to when they say cars run on QNX.\n\nTypically EVs will have many control modules from inverters, battery managemnt, instrument cluster, driver controls, heating, infotainment, brakes, suspension control, power steering control etc etc etc. \nEach of this modules run software that that tier 1 supplier has integrated into their control module. Now some of these control modules will run QNX but by no means all. Now the big thing for QNX is it's a real-time operating system which can run safety critical systems. So start to think steer by wire/brake by wire systems which help simplify a car. And big things when it comes to autonomous cars. \n\nI argue at the moment one of Teslas biggest things is actually their FSD computer and software. The FSD computer. With their autonomous software if it gets them to a fully autonomous car it is a game changer for humanity. Now I don't know what OS Tesla runs on this but I assume it is their own.. \n\nDoes anyone know if QNX is currently being used as an OS for self driving computers? As if it is and it becomes the OS of choice for this. Then there really is big upside in it. QNX has been around a long time though. I beleive it was developed originally in the 80s but assume now it is a very different beast.\n\nAnswer some of the questions on where exactly QNX gets used on EVs and if it is critical to EVs or to autonomous cars then this should give a big indication as to whether or not they are going to be market leaders in a booming sector."", 'Short DD here: People started seeing how undervalued BB is-A company that is a world-renowned brand with the potential to be a major player in two industries of the future-Cybersecurity and IoT trading at just 7/1 P/S ratio. Furthermore QNX is already used by dozens of automakers, but for simple things like audio control systems and BB is not making much money by that. However that is because the industry as a whole has not catched up yet, but Tesla changed that. More and more automakers are accepting the fact that software and self-driving is the future of the industry and that is why BB partnered with Amazon to create a full blown OS for cars. In the future cars will be like huge computers with a lot of sensors that talk to each other and to other cars. With the BB OS, automakers and insurance companies will have access to that data and they also would also have the option to update their software whenever they like. Furthermore, third party developers will be allowed to make different apps for this cross-platform OS. BB might become a huge player, cuz the company was always known about developing hypersecure solutions and security will be extremely important with the development of the IoT.

After that, it can take weeks to months for the transaction to be approved by the gov and officially close, which is when the shares of GME would be given to the target. The way this works is that the target company GME is acquiring would agree on a $ value of the transaction and once the transaction closes, the shares are provided based on GME's share price. Months from now, that share price could fall back to the single digits, which will highly dilute GME's shareholders. \n\nAlso, why would a target company agree to take on stock when that stock price is so volatile? It's not like the acquired company shareholders can just sell their shares in a matter of days. Many of them will also face trading restrictions post-transaction.\n\n\\#2 - I just don't see how a hedge fund manager with true investing experience could think a follow-on / secondary offering could be possible when there's a 30-90 day lock-up period for secondary offerings.

If there are ~70,000,000 shorted shares in the market, then what‚Äôs to say millions of these shares haven‚Äôt been covered that helped to cause today‚Äôs run-up? Would it not easily be diluted into the nearly 200,000,000 trading volume? Since Citadel chose to ‚Äúbail out‚Äù with 3 billion dollars, is this not a red flag in the retard world? Melvin has around 10 million (of the 70 mil) shorted shares. Is it so unlikely that they offloaded these positions during the 65->150 run up? And that they loaded up more short positions or hedge their losses with puts? Citadel is not dumb, they are a force when it comes to capital and have insider info on robinhood trades. they also have interest in keeping shorts alive because they have current GME positions. So the question is: Is citadel just going the throw away 3 billion dollars? Or is there another tactic at play here? \n\nam having a hard time trying to grasp it. I don‚Äôt know how citadel can just throw away 3 billion like that without a tactic, i doubt they can make it back solely on increased volume and ask/buy spreads via robin hood. \n\n2.

How do they know shorts have not been slowly covering over the period of a couple of months? \n\n3. Another problem I‚Äôm having with these newbies posts that they are comparing gme to volkswagen graph. How in what way are these graphs similar??? Yes I understand a short squeeze is happening but if you compare it to volkswagen then a squeeze has already happened. Volkswagen climbed ~200$->1000$ nearly 500%.
