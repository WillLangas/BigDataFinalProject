Cliff's Notes:\\n\\nGME has been shorted to death over the past few years with the conventional wisdom saying that it was essentially going bankrupt being a brick and mortar retailer who's main product has been migrating to online downloads.\\n\\nHowever the DD essentially showed that the stock was way undervalued just based on cash on hand and expected revenues alone. There was no way in hell it would go bankrupt any time soon. Furthermore the average gamer does not have the internet speeds needed to go 100% digital only. Physical purchases will still be required for some time.\\n\\nMichael Burry (Big Short fame) hopped in for a huge chunk with a contrarian play amidst the short frenzy. Ryan Cohen (founder of Chewy) then hopped in as an activist investor and has continued loading up to over 10% for months. The board played a game of chicken with him lining up a shelf offering, but proceeded to flinch after he upped his stake even further.\\n\\nAs all of this has been happening the stock was mooning from the $3-$5 range up to the mid teens and low 20s these past few months, with some nose bleed dips in between. Microsoft has been revealed to have a revenue sharing partnership with GME where GME gets a cut of future digital downloads made on XBoxes originally purchased at GME.\\n\\nThe console cycle hit, and it's clear that alone will be enough to let GME at worse tread water for another 6 months as they allegedly start transitioning to a much larger online presence. Game resale continues to be a decent revenue stream as well.\\n\\nAll the while, short interest has not really let up as of December 31st. \\n\\nRyan Cohen was just recently offered a spot on the board this week and that may have been the final straw for some of these major short players. He turned Chewy into an online phenomenon this year and people are essentially shook that he will take over as an executive at Game Stop and get them headed in the same direction.\\n\\nBottom line, for at least a fraction of shorters the bankruptcy thesis is now blown up and they're looking for a way out without too much bleeding. Melvin Capital was allegedly averaging a borrow price of around $24 per share, but we just blew right past that yesterday.\\n\\nThere are more shorts borrowed then shares in existence right now, and a lot of big dogs are not willing to part ways with them for anything under triple digits a share. So if panic sets in among the shorts we could see a cascade of buying to close positions and the squeeze will officially be squozen.\\n\\nThis is the theory anyhow.\",\n",
